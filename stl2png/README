stl2png
-------

converts a binary STL file to a PNG file in grayscale "heightmap" format, so that tools like
Carbide Create Pro can use it


Note: This tool is in early development and has not been extensively tested yet

Note 2: STL files can express complicated 3D structures, while heightmaps cannot.. but neither can CNC machines
